 hi, i keep getting "num parameter is required" when trying to create a new job 
#### 14:53:42 rundeckuser9
 from the web frontend
#### 14:53:47 rundeckuser9
 is there a fix for this?
#### 15:24:48 gschueler
 hi rundeckuser9 , can you file an issue with that error?
#### 15:24:54 gschueler
 I think I've seen it once before
#### 15:26:18 rundeckuser9
 gschueler: will do
#### 15:27:07 rundeckuser9
 in the meantime where do jobs get stored server side? is it in an xml that i can manually edit?
