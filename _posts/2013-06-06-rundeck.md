 hi KZim

 Hallo.
#### 16:25:21 DinMamma
 Hello*
#### 16:26:09 DinMamma
 Is there any way(hackish or not) to get rundeck to execute tasks on a remote server that would survice a network issue etc?
#### 16:26:42 DinMamma
 If I issue a "yes" on a server, and then restart my rundeck server(it runs in a container, quick enough to bring back up :)) my yes-process obviously dies on the host.
#### 16:26:53 DinMamma
 I need yes to survice a restart of my rundeck-server.
#### 16:28:23 DinMamma
 Or network issue, or anything in between,
#### 16:28:40 DinMamma
 Im going to kick off long running processes that are not allowed to fail due to such things.
#### 16:29:02 DinMamma
 Using cron right now to kick them off, but would be nice with a ceteralized place etc.
#### 16:37:09 Alex-SF
 hi DinMamma 
#### 16:37:18 DinMamma
 Hello
#### 16:37:55 Alex-SF
 so you want to execute a task on a remote node, kind of like a background task
#### 16:38:14 Alex-SF
 so i guess there's a couple of points to make there
#### 16:38:21 DinMamma
 Yes, exactly.
#### 16:38:35 Alex-SF
 #1 is that the ssh dropped connection could propagate a terminate signal. that of course you don't want
#### 16:38:51 Alex-SF
 because that will essentially interrupt your remote process
#### 16:39:31 Alex-SF
 so it's like you want to trigger a managed process on a remote node. I say managed in the sense of "watched over"
#### 16:40:07 DinMamma
 Yep.
#### 16:40:13 Alex-SF
 funny thing is in winrm the idea of a session is more persistent than it is with ssh 
#### 16:40:26 Alex-SF
 i.e., in winrm you create a session that you can reconnect to.
#### 16:40:56 DinMamma
 I could use screen ofc, but I would rather not want to use that.
#### 16:41:14 Alex-SF
 so, this probably sounds like overkill but i do know of cases where people run another rundeck (like it was that watching process). 
#### 16:41:35 Alex-SF
 so one rundeck calls another rundeck. the local rundeck manages the process
#### 16:41:39 DinMamma
 Ah yeah, just hit the api endpoints.
#### 16:41:41 DinMamma
 Thats quite nice.
#### 16:41:42 Alex-SF
 we should think of a lighter wait way
#### 16:42:15 Alex-SF
 but rundeck is small (50MB ). some users have asked about stripping rundeck down so it could be an agent with the same API set
#### 16:42:29 Alex-SF
 i kind of like that idea
#### 16:42:31 DinMamma
 That would be really cool. 
#### 16:43:03 DinMamma
 Especially if the agent kind of stores its jobs locally, so they would be executed even if there is a network outage or watherever is using the cron feature.
#### 16:43:06 Alex-SF
 it solves lots of problems too. for example, the rundeck server could crash or get portioned from the network. When it comes back it could reconnect to the other ones
#### 16:43:10 Alex-SF
 right
#### 16:43:26 Alex-SF
 kind of a federated model
#### 16:43:55 Alex-SF
 btw, i know of a couple users that are doing this kind of thing in windows environments because they don't want to use winrm
#### 16:44:17 Alex-SF
 so they put rundeck on each of the windows nodes and have a "master" rundeck call the api like a NodeExecutor
