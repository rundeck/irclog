 Hallo.

 Hello*
#### 16:26:09 DinMamma
 Is there any way(hackish or not) to get rundeck to execute tasks on a remote server that would survice a network issue etc?
#### 16:26:42 DinMamma
 If I issue a "yes" on a server, and then restart my rundeck server(it runs in a container, quick enough to bring back up :)) my yes-process obviously dies on the host.
#### 16:26:53 DinMamma
 I need yes to survice a restart of my rundeck-server.
#### 16:28:23 DinMamma
 Or network issue, or anything in between,
#### 16:28:40 DinMamma
 Im going to kick off long running processes that are not allowed to fail due to such things.
#### 16:29:02 DinMamma
 Using cron right now to kick them off, but would be nice with a ceteralized place etc.

 Hello
#### 16:37:55 Alex-SF
 so you want to execute a task on a remote node, kind of like a background task
#### 16:38:14 Alex-SF
 so i guess there's a couple of points to make there
