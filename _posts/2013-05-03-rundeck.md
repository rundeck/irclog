 HI Can anyone help on rundeck setup please ...
#### 15:48:54 Toger
 : Is there a way to have all jobs output logged into a central file, so I can hoover it up w/LogStash?

 I inherited a rundeck server a while back. I issued a restart and discovered there are no longer any jobs listed. 
#### 18:26:30 lobstah
 I have EBS snapshots of the system but when I bring those us, I also don't see any jobs listed. Is there some place on the drive where I might find them?
