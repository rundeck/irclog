 HI Can anyone help on rundeck setup please ...
#### 15:48:54 Toger
 : Is there a way to have all jobs output logged into a central file, so I can hoover it up w/LogStash?
#### 18:26:23 lobstah
 I inherited a rundeck server a while back. I issued a restart and discovered there are no longer any jobs listed. 
#### 18:26:30 lobstah
 I have EBS snapshots of the system but when I bring those us, I also don't see any jobs listed. Is there some place on the drive where I might find them?

 hi lobstah 
#### 18:50:52 Alex-SF
 you could use the `rd-jobs` command to dump the jobs tat are in the database
#### 18:51:03 Alex-SF
 is this still a running instance?
#### 18:51:32 Alex-SF
 also, what version and does it use the embedded database?
#### 19:41:29 lobstah
 running 1.5.1, no database, just the file store.
#### 19:41:38 lobstah
 the web UI shows no jobs.
