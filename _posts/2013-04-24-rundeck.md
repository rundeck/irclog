 yes, if you have jobs in two projects pointing at the same end node they could interfere with each other
#### 00:23:26 gschueler
 Rundeck doesn't have a way to prevent that kind of situation. there's no way to declare that two jobs might clobber each other if run on the same node, or even to declare that two nodes in different projects are really the same thing. Basically you are left to not shoot yourself in the foot on your own in that kind of situation :/
