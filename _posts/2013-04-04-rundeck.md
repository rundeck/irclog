 gschueler: First, congrats!
#### 17:49:25 nDuff
 gschueler: Second -- have you had a chance to look at that issue in depth? My take was that a proper fix would require changing semantics currently asserted by the test suite (albeit not documented very clearly in any respect)

 nDuff: i haven't had a chance to dig into it

 gschueler: Is that something that's liable to happen in the reasonably forseeable future? I'm pretty substantially concerned about the potential effects -- ended up restricting all jobs at our site to only use parameters from a hardcoded list, but for folks for whom that isn't an option, shell injection is a pretty real concern.

 If I'm pulling a list from an option model provider URL, is there a way to default to having all the items in the list checked by default?
#### 22:52:15 Alex-SF
 qhartman_: i don't think
