 hi rundeckuser4, are you saying you are implementing options in a rundeck job similar to how you had done w/ controltier 3.6.1?
#### 17:56:11 no
 m using controltier 3.6.1 where m not able to use the feature only with the scheduled dispatch
#### 17:58:25 Alex-SF
 rundeckuser4: i don't have a control tier install running to say
#### 17:59:00 Alex-SF
 though i would imagine it should work as a saved job
#### 18:00:22 it
 is working with manual dispatch..
#### 18:02:23 thank
 Alex for your time, can you refer me anyother irc chat to get a answer for my issue
