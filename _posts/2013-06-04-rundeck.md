 what's the best way to provide a default resource file (with all hosts) ? should i use set project.resources.file in /etc/rundeck/project.properties to a constant e.g /path/to/mysystemwide/resources.xml ? any best practice ?
#### 22:35:12 bensix2
 any idea anyone ?
#### 22:35:27 gschueler
 hi bensix2 , there is no default resource file for projects. however you could create a shared one, and configure each project to have a resolver that uses it
#### 22:36:29 bensix2
 gschueler: resolver ?
#### 22:36:48 gschueler
 sorry, i should say, a "resource model source"
#### 22:53:49 bensix2
 gschueler: yeah ok but that would still require the user to specify it in the field. was trying to rely on a default value so user could just inherit it.
#### 22:54:44 bensix2
 sounds like we cant use project.resources.file for that
#### 22:57:30 Alex-SF
 hi bensix2, i think you can accomplish what you need but it does assume provisioning the projects in a standard way
#### 22:57:45 Alex-SF
 e.g., to configure the project.properties to define that common model source
#### 23:01:06 bensix2
 so i could set project.resources.file in /etc/rundeck/project.properties and NOT set it in /var/rundeck/projects/&lt;myproject&gt;/project.properties ?
#### 23:15:55 gschueler
 actually, I think you could... I haven't tried that functionality in a long time
#### 23:27:37 Alex-SF
 bensix2: were you asking if the resources file needed to be in a certain directory?
