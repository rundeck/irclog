 what's the best way to provide a default resource file (with all hosts) ? should i use set project.resources.file in /etc/rundeck/project.properties to a constant e.g /path/to/mysystemwide/resources.xml ? any best practice ?

 hi bensix2 , there is no default resource file for projects. however you could create a shared one, and configure each project to have a resolver that uses it
