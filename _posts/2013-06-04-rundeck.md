 what's the best way to provide a default resource file (with all hosts) ? should i use set project.resources.file in /etc/rundeck/project.properties to a constant e.g /path/to/mysystemwide/resources.xml ? any best practice ?
#### 22:35:12 bensix2
 any idea anyone ?

 hi bensix2 , there is no default resource file for projects. however you could create a shared one, and configure each project to have a resolver that uses it
#### 22:36:29 bensix2
 gschueler: resolver ?
#### 22:36:48 gschueler
 sorry, i should say, a "resource model source"
#### 22:53:49 bensix2
 gschueler: yeah ok but that would still require the user to specify it in the field. was trying to rely on a default value so user could just inherit it.
#### 22:54:44 bensix2
 sounds like we cant use project.resources.file for that
#### 22:57:30 Alex-SF
 hi bensix2, i think you can accomplish what you need but it does assume provisioning the projects in a standard way
#### 22:57:45 Alex-SF
 e.g., to configure the project.properties to define that common model source
