 Hello I have a rundeck job that gets triggered via Jenkins. That job contains a script that runs a "make" command. If that make command fails it spits out an "error 1" it doesn't error out the job. Do I have to catch that "make" error or something for it to recognize that the command failed ?

 user45435: Did you try to write "set -x" on the row before? I'm not sure this is what you're looking for but it might help you?
