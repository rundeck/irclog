 Alex-SF: gschueler replied some but i was asing : so i could set project.resources.file in /etc/rundeck/project.properties and NOT set it in /var/rundeck/projects/<myproject>/project.properties ?
#### 00:13:15 bensix2
 i wanted to use 1 single resource files shared by all project
#### 00:13:29 Alex-SF
 oh
#### 00:13:36 bensix2
 so using project.resources.file in /etc/rundeck/project.properties was my first guess
#### 00:13:39 Alex-SF
 hmm, i'd have to try that. 
#### 00:14:23 Alex-SF
 so you want it to take precedence of course
#### 00:14:53 bensix2
 since the resource file mainly has hostname, it would make sense to share it in an env where user can all send jobs to the same list of hosts
#### 00:15:25 Alex-SF
 right. more and more, i wonder about having a common resource model for the instance 
#### 00:15:39 bensix2
 i was assuming project.resources.file in /etc/rundeck/project.properties was ging to take precedence and ve the default without even having to set it in each /var/rundeck/projects/<myproject>/project.properties
#### 00:15:54 Alex-SF
 yah, i'll have to try it
#### 00:15:55 bensix2
 s/ve/be
#### 00:15:58 bensix2
 k
#### 00:16:01 Alex-SF
 doing a quick check
#### 00:19:15 Alex-SF
 well hot damn
#### 00:20:59 Alex-SF
 https://gist.github.com/ahonor/51b6e9f12de9d3892372
#### 00:21:44 Alex-SF
 so it seems to work
#### 00:21:57 Alex-SF
 the project level config, doesn't declare it
#### 00:22:09 Alex-SF
 i commented that out (line#21)
#### 00:22:56 Alex-SF
 taking out the comment gives the project level precedence
#### 00:23:36 Alex-SF
 does this map to what you are trying to achieve?
#### 00:34:59 bensix2
 checking
#### 00:37:24 bensix2
 so the project was created without the comment ? sorry am not clear on the workflow: can we first set project.resources.file in /etc/rundeck/project.properties then create a project and it will inherit the project.resources.file from /etc/rundeck/project.properties ?
#### 00:38:41 bensix2
 meaning there will be no project.resources.file in under projects/<myproject>/etc/project.properties ?
#### 00:47:58 nat2610
 looking at the api doc of rundeck, I see a bunch of reference to $RUNDECK_SERVER_URL
#### 00:48:18 nat2610
 but when I dump my environement variables in a job, I don't see that variable set
#### 00:48:23 nat2610
 am I missing something ?
#### 00:49:41 Alex-SF
 hi nat2610, no that is just confusing documentation
#### 00:49:58 Alex-SF
 it means use the base url for that install
#### 00:50:05 nat2610
 how can I find it ? 
#### 00:50:17 nat2610
 without hard coded that ?
#### 00:50:31 Alex-SF
 oh are you writing a job that needs to know it?
#### 00:50:43 nat2610
 I have a setup with multiple rundeck (1 per environement) 
#### 00:50:49 nat2610
 and I'd like to reuse the same job
#### 00:51:00 nat2610
 but in order to do my api calls, I need to craft the urls
#### 00:51:15 Alex-SF
 right. one rundeck instance needs to know the url of another rundeck instance?
#### 00:51:17 nat2610
 and depending on the environement it will be a different hostname 
#### 00:51:49 nat2610
 no, but I'm doing a job that deploy artifacts using dispatch
#### 00:52:08 nat2610
 and so when the script run on a given host, it needs to know where to authenticate etc.. 
#### 00:52:11 nat2610
 isn't it ?
