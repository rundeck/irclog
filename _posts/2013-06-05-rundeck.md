 Alex-SF: gschueler replied some but i was asing : so i could set project.resources.file in /etc/rundeck/project.properties and NOT set it in /var/rundeck/projects/<myproject>/project.properties ?
#### 00:13:15 bensix2
 i wanted to use 1 single resource files shared by all project
#### 00:13:29 Alex-SF
 oh
#### 00:13:36 bensix2
 so using project.resources.file in /etc/rundeck/project.properties was my first guess
#### 00:13:39 Alex-SF
 hmm, i'd have to try that. 
#### 00:14:23 Alex-SF
 so you want it to take precedence of course
#### 00:14:53 bensix2
 since the resource file mainly has hostname, it would make sense to share it in an env where user can all send jobs to the same list of hosts
