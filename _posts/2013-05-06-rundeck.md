 is it possible to have a workflow where step 1 applies to node set N, and step 2 applies to node set M?
#### 22:15:16 silk
 you can create 2 jobs, with different node sets, and wrap them in a job that calls each in turn
#### 22:15:19 silk
 if thats what you meant
#### 22:15:37 kindjal
 yeah I think I don't know about job nesting...
#### 22:15:45 kindjal
 what I want is...
#### 22:15:51 kindjal
 issue a command...
#### 22:15:57 kindjal
 then watch and wait for something to happen...
#### 22:16:03 kindjal
 then when I see that thing happen run another command...
#### 22:16:09 kindjal
 repeat that over sets of nodes in turn.

 I have an HPC cluster with 400 nodes. I want to close them to new jobs, wait for jobs to finish, then run a command, then re-open them, in batches of say 10 or 20 nodes.
#### 22:18:53 silk
 im not sure I completely understand, but you want to execute a cmd (close), wait for something, execute a cmd(open) on 10 nodes, then move to the next batch of 10?
#### 22:19:11 silk
 until all 400 nodes have had that happen?
