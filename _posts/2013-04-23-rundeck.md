 So i think this is a bad idea, but im trying to find documentation to agree with me. Is it a Bad Idea to define the same node in multiple projects?
#### 22:36:47 silk
 Im trying to find reference to only running a single job on a single node at a given timeâ€¦. I thought I read it but cant find it again.

 hi silk 
#### 23:48:31 Alex-SF
 no it's not uncommon to represent the same host in more than one project
#### 23:49:02 Alex-SF
 there are a couple ways to run a job on a single node
#### 23:49:07 silk
 cool. was it my imagination that thought there was some locking internal to rundeck to prevent clashing job executions?
