 Hey quick question - anyone using specific variables/options per node context for jobs
#### 01:01:33 rundeckuser7
 i.e same job, node1 uses value x node2 uses value y
#### 01:04:13 rundeckuser7
 ... maybe not. Anyway I found attributes seem to work however I haven't found any documentation: echo I am ${node.name} on ${node.hostname}
