 I don't see any stacktrace being generated, and here are last couple lines from the rundeck.log: 2013-04-16 08:40:06,374 \[1870277025@qtp-2099901365-0\] WARN grails.app.service.rundeck.services.FrameworkService - rdeck.base is: /etc/rundeck

#### 15:46:00 Alex-SF
 is "krkenv05saapp1" an example windows node?
#### 15:46:07 ckm
 yes
#### 15:46:25 ckm
 I use winrs windows command to test that node, and it works just fine
#### 15:46:27 Alex-SF
 ok, so that's related
#### 15:46:36 ckm
 relates to?
#### 15:46:47 Alex-SF
 oh the error in the stack trace is related to the winrm problem
#### 15:47:30 Alex-SF
 i'm not sure if configuring run deck log4j to DEBUG level will expose more info from the plugin
#### 15:47:31 ckm
 is this caused by incorrect version or configuration?
#### 15:47:40 Alex-SF
 i'm not sure. just trying to get more info
#### 15:48:01 ckm
 the previous paste I put on is already have debug turn on
#### 15:48:15 Alex-SF
 debug already set for log4j?
#### 15:48:16 ckm
 but it didn't give more information 
#### 15:48:40 ckm
 I set dropdown to debug when I ran the job
#### 15:49:03 ckm
 log level set to debug
#### 15:49:09 Alex-SF
 oh, that's just the log level for the job. there is a global flag which turns on more debug in the service.log
#### 15:49:25 ckm
 how do I set it?
#### 15:49:42 ckm
 need to set from project.properteis file?
#### 15:49:49 ckm
 or framework.properties?
#### 15:49:56 Alex-SF
 no, it's in RDECK_BASE/etc/log4j.properties
#### 15:50:13 Alex-SF
 is this a Launcher or RPM type install?
#### 15:50:24 ckm
 it is deb
#### 15:50:33 Alex-SF
 ok, similar to rpm then
#### 15:50:53 ckm
 yep
#### 15:51:09 ckm
 how do I turn on debug from log4j?
#### 15:51:22 Alex-SF
 take a look for /etc/rundeck/log4j.properties
#### 15:51:30 ckm
 I am on it
#### 15:51:51 Alex-SF
 ok. set: log4j.rootCategory=DEBUG, file
#### 15:52:25 ckm
 so need to add this key?
#### 15:52:26 ckm
 right
#### 15:52:45 Alex-SF
 the current value will say INFO
#### 15:53:01 ckm
 ok
#### 15:53:35 Alex-SF
 after changing it to DEBUG, go ahead and restart
#### 15:53:42 ckm
 I just did
#### 15:53:47 ckm
 I will run the job again
#### 15:53:57 Alex-SF
 ok, you should see a lot more messages in the service.log
#### 15:55:36 ckm
 this is what I got after DEBUG is set, 2013-04-16 08:52:02.667:/:INFO: Destroying Spring FrameworkServlet 'gsp'

 looks like normal startup messages, so far
#### 15:58:08 ckm
 yes, not much information there
#### 15:59:22 Alex-SF
 did you already run a job to the windows node?
#### 15:59:49 ckm
 yes
#### 16:00:03 Alex-SF
 ok. so yah it didn't produce any extra error context
#### 16:00:20 ckm
 no
#### 16:00:51 Alex-SF
 ckm, did you post as "wildxy49"?
#### 16:01:07 Alex-SF
 (post to the google group)
#### 16:01:10 ckm
 yes
#### 16:01:16 Alex-SF
 ok. just wanted to be sure
#### 16:01:36 ckm
 I post it there but no reply, that why I came over here
#### 16:01:46 Alex-SF
 i wonder if there is a problem with 1.5 with respect to that plugin. 
#### 16:02:04 Alex-SF
 i know there are a couple people working on upgrading the plugin but i am not sure about their status
#### 16:02:33 ckm
 so this mean I may have to fallback to 1.4 for winrm
#### 16:02:47 ckm
 or I have to use ssh until the problem gets resolved
#### 16:03:06 Alex-SF
 they upgraded the plugin to use a newer version of the underlying library (overthere). I'll reply to your post
#### 16:05:29 ckm
 ok
#### 20:19:47 gschueler
 hi Diranged what is the problem?
#### 20:20:53 Diranged
 hey
#### 20:20:53 Diranged
 http://pastie.org/7612219
#### 20:21:08 Diranged
 so thast my default.aclpolicy file… i have other policies that give specific groups access to specific projects.
#### 20:21:33 Diranged
 but what i have found is that this policy doesn't work — i have to change the '.*' to a specific group name to let people log into rundeck at all.. 
#### 20:21:49 Diranged
 I'm just confused about how to do a group wildcard.. 
#### 20:29:44 gschueler
 groups/users can't use a wildcard
#### 20:30:33 Diranged
 really .. that should be documented .:)
#### 20:30:41 Diranged
 so how can i say "all groups" can log in.. or rather, all users can log in
#### 20:31:52 gschueler
 you would have to put all users in a default group, e.g. "users", then add aclpolicy for that group
#### 20:32:12 gschueler
 for some reason
#### 20:34:40 gschueler
 can't say there's still a good reason for it. you should file an enhancement request to change that
#### 20:41:06 Diranged
 ok
#### 20:41:19 Diranged
 for now i have a workaround.. but ill file a request
#### 20:42:17 gschueler
 ok. you can also list multiple groups instead, if you have a static list of them
#### 20:43:50 Diranged
 so i can just do 2 group lines?
#### 20:44:05 Diranged
 one right after the other?
#### 20:49:07 gschueler
 as shown here: http://rundeck.org/docs/manpages/man5/aclpolicy-v10.html#by
#### 20:49:24 gschueler
 using a yaml sequence
